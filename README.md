# Hello-World
Just getting started
//I was told by the tutorial to do this section.//
My name is Chris and I am primarily an Illustrator but I REALLY want to learn to code and get a better job so I can potentially work from home and take care of my family. My significant other is an amazing woman named Rosa that is creative, kind and caring. She is always there to help and she deserves the best life I can possibly give her. I am going to work hard despite my disability to make a good future for the rest of our years and let her decide how she wants to use her time. She never has enough time to do the things she loves and while life does that to all of us at some point, I'm not going to let her lose her love of life from some soul sucking job. Let's get this job done!
